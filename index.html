        <h2 id="content">Biography
            <p>I was born on August 8, 1996 in Baltimore, MD along with my three other siblings, Sarah, Joshua and Caleb. Yes, I am a quadruplet! We moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico when we were under a year to be closer to family. I spent my childhood there and learned piano, loved to sing and did ballet, gymnastics and drill team at different points growing up. After my parents split in middle school we decided to move to Austin, Texas with my mom. We went to Regents School of Austin for high school, frequently visiting my dad in Albuquerque. It was a challenging school in many ways and for a variety of family reasons, we all decided to drop out and get our GED's after our Junior year.  </p>
